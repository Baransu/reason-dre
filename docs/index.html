          ReasonML is a solid language by itself, and BuckleScript is a fantastic compiler. However interop
          is needed, and one of the most confusing parts of writing ReasonML is writing bindings to JS globals
          and npm libraries. With BuckleScript, those bindings are written as part of the code itself. It's a
          really flexable system and aligns closely with OCaml's C interop, but it can be a huge point of
          confusion for newcomers. One of the main reasons behind this is that there's little direction on
          where to go for some common JS idioms, like classes, interfaces, and functions that can take different
          types of arguments. The tools are there, but they are difficult to discover and it takes time to learn
          how to bind to various JS constructs.

          There's a few JS type systems out there, like Flow and TypeScript, that offer a more declarative way
          of introducing JS constructs into their type system. The easy part for them is that they don't have
          to add a runtime or make those JS constructs idiomatic, because they're type systems on top of JS!
          But those type systems have a ton of types written for them (especially TypeScript) because they're
          stright-forward to write for a lot of the JS community.
